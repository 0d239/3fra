    <h1>on war</h1>
    <p class="muted">2025-11-11</p>
    <h2> comprehensive list of things that are war: </h2>
    <li> everything </li>
    <h2> i didn't always know this. </h2>
    <p> this truth is unoriginal but uncommon. its presence is established consistently across time but not experience </p>
    <p> perhaps that line of thiniking is a burden that many are fortunate to not need, and others are unfortunate to not encounter in their times of need. </p>
    <h2> our experience of time and its implications: </h2>
    <p> for practical intents and purposes, as defined by our capacity to interact with it, time approaches infinitely. </p>
    <p> the presence of a new moment will always join the presence of an achieved victory. </p>
    <p> in some situations victory can be inherited from past moments into this new moment. this inheritance can be partial or full. </p>
    <p> however, many forms of this inheritance decay over time. </p>
    <p> money is not as effective at making you happy as you spend more years acclimating to wealth. mountaintops have a way of providing amnesia for the valley's prayers. </p>
    <p> it is reasonable to conclude that time's observed pattern of constance is likely to continue. consequently, given sufficient time t0, one may be fortunate enough to conclude that their best chance at repetitive victory is systems for repetitive engagement. </p>
    <p> repetitive engagement begings to converge upon the underlying philosophies that inspired this post. </p>
    <h2> everything is war. </h2>
    <p> we don't claim territories today over yesterdays victory. we do it with today's battles. which are won by today's gunfire and lost by today's lack of defense and tactics. </p>
    <p> constant, predictable victory is the product of constant, predictable militance. </p>
    <p> everyday my trenches advance. and while we don't advance, we reinforce. </p>
    <h2> today belongs to the king. tomorrow belongs to the vigilant and diligent. </h2>
    <p> i live without fear and i'll die by my blade </p>
