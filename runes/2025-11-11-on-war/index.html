    <h1>on war</h1>
    <p class="muted">2025-11-11</p>
    <h2> comprehensive list of things that are war: </h2>
    <li> everything </li>
    <h2> i didn't always know this. </h2>
    <p> this truth is established consistently across time but not experience </p>
    <p> perhaps that line of thiniking is a burden that many are fortunate to not need, and others are never fortunate enough to encounter. </p>
    <h2> our experience of time and its implications: </h2>
    <p> time approaches infinitely. </p>
    <p> any achieved victory will soon be joined by the presence of a new moment. </p>
    <p> in some situations victory can be inherited from past moments into this new moment. this inheritance can be partial or full. </p>
    <p> however, many forms of this inheritance decay over time. </p>
    <p> money is not as effective at making you happy as you spend more years acclimating to wealth. mountaintops use amnesia to crosspollinate the prayers of the valleys. </p>
    <h2> everything is war. </h2>
    <p> today's conquests are the product of today's battles. which are won and lost by today's gunfire and defense. </p>
    <p> constant, predictable victory is the product of constant, predictable militance. </p>
    <p> everyday my trenches advance or reinforce. </p>
    <h2> today belongs to the king. tomorrow belongs to the vigilant. </h2>
    <p> i live without fear and i'll die by my blade </p>
