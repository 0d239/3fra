0:11 he say he know my pain, but i was broke and when i went to hoop - they crossed me out my primos jays!

0:16 from hardly anyone involved, to everybody standing round, to everybody catching strays!

0:22 and it get hard to see your books, you sittin up behind your nose - a lotta paths a lotta ways

0:32 i had my boots up in the blizzard, but my baby helped me thaw i got to 32 degress

0:37 i made it hard to find the forest - i was tryna find a view but i was blocked by all the trees

0:42 a thousand whispers from the willow - hear em tell me when they think i’m getting closer to my dreams

0:47 but then depending on the ones the raza’s talking bout i fear that there’s a lot that it could mean

0:52 girl i admit i wasn’t living, i was doing all this math, had all these numbers in my head

0:57 and then i started drinking monster, money turned me to a monster - got a job under my bed

1:02 and i been really tryna learn like what’s the point of even walking? what is glitter? what is gleam?

1:07 I wake up and i ask a question to the man inside the mirror: what you getting out the cream?

1:12 girl it’s the middle of the night, and i been walking in the mud, and i been out here making plays!

1:18 he said he know my pain, but i was broke and when i went to hoop - they crossed me out my primos jays!

1:20 i’m walking round till i remember, my embers
