this song started as that final piece starting with 'walking round till i remember, my embers'

that was its own track on the viral creed tiktok edit sound

it was pretty cool but also kinda random

this is of course the 'closer to my dreams' instrumental 

so i might get sued but drake(o) both went over it and they were fine 

so that lady can come get it back in blood

this song was originally named willow because i was tickled by the overlookable reference to ancestry 

however, then i leaned into 'raza' just due to listening enough to grow away from old ideas 

after some more time it was renamed again: back to 'embers'

(embers was the name of the original creeed edit song that got vamped to make this)

finally, i arrived back at 'willow' for the same original reasons

imbalance between time examing ideas and time taking resultant action has emerged to me as a primary concern for awareness when scanning for threats to self-belief

may the calibration of balances converge to a difficulty that behaves like the difficulty required to speak about their necessity
