this song started as just that final piece starting with 'walking round till i remember, my embers'

that was its own track on the viral creed tiktok edit sound

it was pretty cool but also kinda random

this is of course the 'closer to my dreams' instrumental so i might get sued but drake(o) both went over it and they were fine so that lady can come get it back in blood

this song was originally named willow because i really liked the light, overlookable reference to ancestry. however, then i leaned into 'raza' as a title as a product of listening and noting relevant moments. 

after some more time it was named 'embers'(after the original creeed edit song that i vamped for this one), but then finally i arrived back at willow. my favorite idea of the song besides the primo j's i believe.
