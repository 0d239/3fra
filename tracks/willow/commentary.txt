this song started as just that final piece starting with 'walking round till i remember, my embers'

that was its own track on the viral creed tiktok edit sound

it was pretty cool but also kinda random

this is of course the 'closer to my dreams' instrumental so i might get sued but drake(o) both went over it and they were fine so that lady can come get it back in blood
