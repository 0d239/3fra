don't worry i can't really understand me on this one either

it sure was fun though

the 'ain't been seem i'm getting time' thing was originally either 'it ain't seem i been getting time' or 'who the fuck get all the time?'

in the end i stuck with the half-wrong gibberish cuz it felt spiritiually correct
