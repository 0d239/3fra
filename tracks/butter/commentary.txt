this song is all about spelling good morning

no shade to drums but i love beats without them

one day i'll prob drop a project that has zero drum sounds

i eventually found another beat that used this sample that has drums. that may or not also be on the album. and may or may not take advantage of parallelism in some way that would be inferrable from the positon of this song on the tracklist.
