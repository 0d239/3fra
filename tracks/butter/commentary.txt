translation: "buenos dias"

no shade to drums but i got a thing for beats without them

one day i'll drop a project or ep that has zero drum sounds

i eventually found another beat that used this sample that has drums. that may or not also be on the album. and may or may not take advantage of parallelism in some way that would be inferrable from the positon of this song on the tracklist.
